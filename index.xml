      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Andy Roberts and welcome to my Blog!
I wanted to start a blog for a while, as I working in the IT &amp;amp; Cloud Industry, I get so much value finding resources and useful knowledge from people using their free time to post blogs to share with others. So I thought it was about time I start giving back and do the same!
Currently I live in Auckland, New Zealand and work for a company called Vista Entertainment as a Cloud Engineer.</description>
