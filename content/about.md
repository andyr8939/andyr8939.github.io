Hi, I'm Andy Roberts and welcome to my Blog!

![its me](/andy.jpg)

Currently I live in Auckland, New Zealand and work for a company called [Vista Entertainment](https://www.vista.co) as a Cloud Engineer.   Day to day, this means I am working primarily with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), but also with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).  So each day I'm building infrastructure, automating deployments with tools such as Powershell and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and generally all things Cloud.

Before that I spent several years with companies such as [WEX Inc](https://www.wexinc.com) which is where I honed my Cloud skills working on some pretty massive AWS deployments.  As well as that I enjoyed a lot of exposure to multiple companies infrastrcture, both cloud and on-prem with Engineer and Sys Admin roles at companies such as [DXC](https://www.dxc.technology) and [Unisys](https://www.unisys.com).

Outside of my day job I'm a dad to two amazing girls and an even more amazing wife, living in Auckland, NZ after leaving the UK 12 years ago.  I used to be a "semi-professional" racing driver, which means I was doing it seriously enough to to try and make it a career, but I wasn't being paid for it haha!  I won 3 British Karting titles before moving into cars, racing in the UK and the USA, and in general just being a motorsport fan.  As well as that I'm now an avid runner, completing my first Half Marathon in 2020 and now trying to talk myself into entering an [IronMan Triathlon](https://www.ironman.com/im-new-zealand)!!!

I hope you find the blog topics useful and any feedback is always appreciated!
