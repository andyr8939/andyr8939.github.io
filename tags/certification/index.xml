      <description>The Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) had been on my radar for a while, but my passion for not enjoying exams kept from committing to it. But after running into some curly Kubernetes at work I decided I would give it a try as even if I failed, the learning aspect of it would be most valuable.
Background - I use Kubernetes, well AKS, A LOT in my day job. I am part of a team which designs/deploys/manages around 30 AKS clusters in many different regions, with lots of different workloads on them, plus also chucking in the dreaded Windows node pools for good measure.</description>
