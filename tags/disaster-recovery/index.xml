      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a blog post, but I wanted to jump back in again with big one, Disaster Recovery!
Traditionally with DR in a Virtual Machine infrastructure, you would replicate the VMs/Disks etc to your DR location, and when you initial a failover you simply start them up. This works well in a VM environment because you would normally spend a fair amount of time configuring them, either manually (I hope not) or with Automation, but either way its time consuming but well understood.</description>
