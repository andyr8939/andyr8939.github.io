      <description>AKS and Kubernetes in general is still fairly new to me, but its something I am using more and more every day. One of the challenges I have faced is that the more I have to deploy to is, is the need for a simple way to deploy a set of apps you need on every cluster, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve a complicated solution. I am an &amp;lsquo;Ops&amp;rsquo; guy by trade so creating release artifacts and NuGet packages doesn&amp;rsquo;t come naturally too me.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll preface this blog post with the fact that I am FAR FAR away from any kind of expert on Kubernetes and AKS. I am still very early in my journey with it, and a lot of my experience so far is trial and error. I have also found that there is a lot of documentation out there on how to do things, but a lot of it assumes a fairly decent knowledge of how everything sticks together, so for a newbie to Kubernetes it can be quite challenging.</description>
