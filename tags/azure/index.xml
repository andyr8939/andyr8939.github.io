      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll preface this blog post with the fact that I am FAR FAR away from any kind of expert on Kubernetes and AKS. I am still very early in my journey with it, and a lot of my experience so far is trial and error. I have also found that there is a lot of documentation out there on how to do things, but a lot of it assumes a fairly decent knowledge of how everything sticks together, so for a newbie to Kubernetes it can be quite challenging.</description>

      <description>Backups are a necessity but it still amazes me the amount of companies I have worked at where you find backups are just not done, or just as bad, are done but are never checked!
There are multiple ways to do backups depending where your data lives. Veeam, BackupExec, etc, but if you are running your infrastructure in Azure and you are using Virtual Machines then Azure Backup is an amazing tool for this.</description>

      <description>Web Frontend&amp;rsquo;s are probably one of the most used workloads in Cloud today. Your ingress is basically your income for many companies, and technologies used such as Apache, NGINX, IIS mixed with your edge devices make up this stack.
In my current role we make heavy use of Azure Application Gateways which are L7 HTTP(S) Load Balancers for our web front end. As the products we supply to clients are web based these are a perfect fit for our needs.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Andy Roberts and welcome to my Blog!
I wanted to start a blog for a while, as I working in the IT &amp;amp; Cloud Industry, I get so much value finding resources and useful knowledge from people using their free time to post blogs to share with others. So I thought it was about time I start giving back and do the same!
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write as many articles as I can find time on with useful guides to what I have been working on, in the hope it helps people like you when searching out how to do something.</description>
